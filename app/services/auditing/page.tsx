      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Medical Auditing</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Hospitals and health systems must maintain accurate code assignments to optimize
        reimbursements, accurately reflecting quality services, regulatory and compliance
        liabilities. Citrux Health Solutions offers comprehensive auditing solutions to support
        Healthcare Providers with medical auditing for Inpatient, Outpatient, and Professional Fee
        coding.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Citrux&apos;s medical coding audits help you better understand the return on investment (ROI)
        and accuracy of each individual coder on your team as well as your investment in external
        contract coding resources. In addition to monitoring and improving the accuracy of coders,
        our third-party auditing solutions also help identify Clinical Documentation Improvement
        (CDI) opportunities resulting in decreased Physician Queries for accurate and specified code
        assignment.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Customizable Frequency & Sample Size</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The frequency of audits can be tailored to meet the specific needs of each individual
        hospital or health system. Solutions can be availed per clientsâ€™ needs bi-annually,
        quarterly, or other desired parameters depending on the interest and goals. Support can be
        provided on all chart types, specific chart types, specific coders, high alert cases (RAC,
        OIG, etc.), or other focused areas. Citrux can accommodate your preferred sample sizes or
        provide the recommended sample sizes for different charts types and/or code sets to be
        audited.
